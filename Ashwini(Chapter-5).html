        <h2 class="b"><b>Chapter 5. Migrating from Tivoli NetView for z/OS V6R2</b></h2>
        <p>When you are migrating from the Tivoli NetView for z/OS V6R2, you can either add the NetView V6R3<br> content into your V6R2 NetView definitions, or add your V6R2 customization to the default V6R3<br> members supplied with the NetView program. Either way, place the customized member into an<br> appropriate user-allocated data set such as NETVIEW.V6R3USER.CNM01.DSIPARM. Do not customize<br> members in the SMP/E-managed data sets such as NETVIEW.V6R3M0.DSIPARM.<br>
            Usage note: The migration information is based on the NetView components that are supplied with the<br> initial release of V6R3. Review your maintenance to see if you already made some of the changes.<br>
            Several factors can influence the method that you use when migrating your NetView definition members.<br> Factors such as the size and complexity of your network, security policies that must be followed, and<br> established practices within your business can all influence what is the best method for your migration.<br> The checklist that follows details the documented method of migration as outlined in this book and<br> supported by other books in the NetView library. Choose the method of migration that is best for you.<br>
            Do the following steps to migrate your V6R2 definitions:</li><br>
            <li>1.	Allocate a new set of V6R3 user data sets by running the CNMSJ002 sample job. You did this when you<br> completed the steps in Table 12 on page 16.</li><br>
            <li>2.	Define a unique &NV2I value (xx) for each NetView domain.</li><br>
            <li>3.	Review your customized V6R2 copy of the CNMSTYLE member. If you did not already do so, move all<br> of your domain-specific customization of V6R2 CNMSTYLE statements into the CxxSTGEN member<br> and all of your system-wide customization of V6R2 CNMSTYLE statements into the CNMSTUSR<br> member. Do not copy your V6R2 CNMSTYLE member into the V6R3 user DSIPARM data set.</li><br>
            <li>4.	Review the CNMSTYLE information in this chapter and the V6R3 CNMSTNXT member that is included<br> with the NetView program. Place any domain-specific customization of CNMSTYLE statements into the<br> CxxSTGEN member and any system-wide customization of CNMSTYLE statements into the CNMSTUSR<br> member. Do not modify the V6R3 default CNMSTYLE member.</li><br>
            <li>5.	Review the remaining information in this chapter, and migrate your V6R2 NetView definition members<br> and JCL procedures as appropriate, placing only those members that were modified into the V6R3<br> user data sets.</li><br>
            Figure 4 on page 73 shows the NetView V6R3 initialization flow. Keep this new initialization flow in mind<br> as you make changes to your DSIPARM members.<br>

            <h3><b>Message Logging</b></h3>
            <p>With NetView V6R2M1 APARs OA55071 and OA55074, changes have been made to the format of the<br> Canzlog data space (CNMCANZ0). If a NetView V6R2 instance will be running on the same LPAR as a<br> NetView V6R2M1 instance with the specified APARs applied, the NetView V6R2 instance must have<br> compatibility APAR OA56128 applied.<br>
                As of NetView V6R3, changes have been made to the format of the Canzlog archive data spaces<br> (CNMCANZ1, CNMCANZ2,...,CNMCANZA) to reduce the amount of virtual storage required to browse<br> <i>Canzlog archives. See the IBM Z NetView Administration Reference for more information.</i><br>

<p>Enterprise Management Agents changes	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Enterprise Management Agents changes</u><br>
<h3><b>IBM Z NetView and IBM Z NetView Enterprise Management Agent Versions</b></h3><br>
<p>The IBM Z NetView Enterprise Management Agent (NetView agent) requires Tivoli Management Services<br> V6.3.0 Fixpack 7. If you are not currently running at this level, upgrade the following components to the<br> V6.3.0 Fixpack 7 level before you install the NetView agent:<br>
    •	Tivoli Enterprise Portal desktop client<br>
    •	Tivoli Enterprise Portal Server<br>
    •	Hub Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Server<br>
    The NetView program is the data source for the NetView<br> agent. Because of this, both the NetView program and the NetView agent must be at the V6R3 level.<br>
    Before upgrading the NetView agent, review the IBM OMEGAMON and Tivoli Management Services on z/OS<br> shared documentation Upgrade Guide. The general order of upgrade procedures documented for the<br> OMEGAMON XE V5.1 and later monitoring agents also applies to the NetView agent.<br>
    Prior to IBM Tivoli Monitoring V6.2.3, before an agent could connect to a Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring <br>Server, you were required to manually update the monitoring server (and other Tivoli Management<br> Services components such as the Tivoli Enterprise Portal Server and the Tivoli Data Warehouse) with<br> information necessary for the monitoring server to recognize and process data sent by that agent. As of<br> V6.2.3, this seeding step becomes unnecessary. The NetView agent has been enhanced with the optional<br> self-description feature that automatically distributes the operating configuration directly to the local<br> monitoring server, which then distributes those agent configuration files first to the hub monitoring server<br> (if necessary) and then to the various IBM Tivoli Monitoring components that require it.<br>
    For a list of changes to the NetView agent that were made in Version 6.2.1, see <u>“Enterprise Management<br> Agent Changes” on page 150.<br></u>
